# üß© 50 Frontend Challenges

This repository contains a collection of frontend development mini-projects, created as part of my learning journey. Each challenge resides in its own folder and focuses on a specific feature or interaction built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The projects were based on a Udemy course. I implemented each one independently to deepen my understanding. In addition, the repo contains several original mini-projects designed entirely by me.

## üß† Notes
Each project was written from scratch based on a video introduction to the concept. I used the course only as reference ‚Äî all code is my own.
Some projects are original ideas beyond the course scope.
No frameworks, build tools or external libraries are used ‚Äî this is pure frontend logic.
